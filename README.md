# Synacor Challenge

This repository contains a set of files that helped me solve the [Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/).

The binary file containing the whole challenge is in `challenge.bin`, while the virtual machine needed to decode it and solve the challenge is described in the `arch-spec` file.

The VM is implemented in JavaScript using `node.js` in `challenge.js` and use helper functions defined in `disassembler.js`.

The file `find_coins.js` and `vault.js` solve two challenges encountered during the challenge using JavaScript, while `heavy_function.py` solves the teleporter challenge using the memoization in Python.

Finally, the `Notes` files correspond to the notes I took during the challenge.
